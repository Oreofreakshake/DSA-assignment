## Assignment for my Data Structures and Algorithm class

-   You can use this for your projects and what not although, most of the algorithms in this repo can simply be imported as a library (which is more convenient)

sorry for the spegatti code, I had less than an hour to submit this and I probably won't clean the code as I will be busy with other projects or lazy enough to not care about this repo but If you want to clean the code or perhaps make it better you are welcome to do so.

`spegatti code or not the logic for most of the important sorting algorithms will be here, linear and binary search are pretty basic but the logic for them will also be here`

## Score

`I'll update when I get graded`
