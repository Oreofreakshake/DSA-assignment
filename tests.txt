# How I have tested the code    
## Succeeded code = 100%
## failed code = 0%
- I created bunch of data to push into the array, in the data it included 
    - Integers
    - Duplicates
    - Non Integers (Floats, Strings)
- of course anything other than Integers should not be accepted as a data type in the array thats being used to sort and search so Ive' used int return methods which forces you to use int values
- the sort algorithm speeds were recoded and commented next to the object class
