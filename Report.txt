## Search algorithms
### Linear search
- It wasn't fast when compared with binary search but as the hardware nowadays are very reliable it was fast in the comprehensive of the human brain
- although it was a solid avg 500 milisecond slower in 10 different searches than Binary search

### Binary search
- The fasted out of the two searching algorithms I was asked to implement in this assignment
- avg of 500 milisecond faster in 10 searches

## Sort algorithms
`speed are documented on the code as comments, following list are order from the least convenient to the best`

### Linear Sort
- Extremely slow just as the theory suggests O(n) speed

### Bubble Sort
- Not that fast but it is acceptable, with the speed of O(n) although in average it was O(n^2)

### Selection Sort
- speed of O(n^2) will not use for sorting data 

### Insertion Sort
- Equally as fast as the bubble sort, in average it shows O(n), at worst it gave O(n^2) 

### Quick Sort
- One of the fastest with the speed of O(n log n) worst hitting O(n^2)

### Merge Sort
- Fasted out of the given sorting algorithms, giving O(n log n) in both average and worst, 100% will recommend to use this algorithm for sorting
